            <pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 10:00:00 +1000</pubDate>
            <category>Statistical Training Program</category>
            <description>(09 February 2022 10:00 am - 01:00 pm) This session starts with a non-mathematical introduction to the underlying logic: revisiting variables and dependence, association vs causality, assumptions vs evidence of causality, and issues such as falsification or accumulation of evidence, counterfactuals and experiments. Then we distil the basic building blocks of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and their representation both in pictures and in the simple math of a regression model, avoiding the math of computation.</description>

            <category>Statistical Training Program</category>
            <description>(14 February 2022 10:00 am - 03:30 pm) In this workshop we discuss how latent constructs in SEM are used to create an indirect measurement of a concept or theme via multiple items. We show how validity of constructs can be evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We will also discuss how CFA differs from alternative methods of forming a construct such as a simple average of items or an exploratory factor analysis (EFA).</description>

            <title>Systematic Quantitative Literature Review (SQLR) &amp; Advancing SQLR</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 10:00:00 +1000</pubDate>
            <category>Methodology Training</category>
            <description>(17 February 2022 10:00 am - 11:30 am) Systematic quantitative literature review is a smart and effective method for undertaking literature reviews, particularly for research students and others exploring new disciplines. It bridges the gap between traditional narrative review methods and meta-analysis. Narrative methods that are common in research theses, rely on the expertise and experience of the author, making them challenging for novices to produce and publish.</description>

            <category>Statistical Training Program</category>
            <description>(01 March 2022 10:00 am - 01:00 pm) This workshop follows on from &quot;Latent Constructs in SEM&quot;. In this workshop we use a pathway analysis, implemented in R, to relate several variables as well as constructs created via CFA. This includes discussion of what these pathways mean, how they are interpreted, and how to estimate mediation and total effects.</description>

            <category>Statistical Training Program</category>
            <description>(14 March 2022 10:00 am - 01:00 pm) This workshop is structured as a reading group on SEM. This is a classic structure used in academia, with researchers (including HDRs) learning about a new topic in a group.<br />
Because of this, there will be very little material presented by the facilitator. Instead, participants are asked to comment on their reading of a portion of at least one paper from among those listed. The facilitator may add to the discussion, which is initiated by participants.</description>
